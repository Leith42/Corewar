**Core War was inspired by a malicious virus written in the 80â€™s.** To deal with the self-replicating virus, a white hat hacker invented Reaper. It was a virus designed to spread and eliminate the malware. He fought fire with fire.

This inspired A. K. Dewdney to coin the idea for Core War.

The idea was simple. You compete by designing viruses to overtake a computer. You win by protecting your own program and overwriting your opponent's programs. This is all happening on a virtual computer. Think, a simple computer within your computer. 

There are three main components to determine who wins: 

- **Game rounds**, every game round is measured in cycles. It determines how much each cursor can read from the game board. 
- **Lives**, if a cursor reads a player life from the game board, they are given a life for that round. These are visualized in the colorful progress bars. 
- **Cycle to die**, for every game round, the number of bytes a cursor can read from the game board is reduced.

You win if your program is the last one to receive a life.
